My name is Ezra Ogianyo and I am a Trainee Software Engeenir. I have previous work experience in tech as a Program Analyst and a Product Manager. I have always wanted to transition into software development, and in that regard, I have taken and completed the Udacity Introduction to Programming Nanodegree program as well as the Design-U Developer School program. I am also currently completing a Diploma course in Software Engineering from AltSchool Africa. During the course of those programs, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript, Python, Git, and Github.
